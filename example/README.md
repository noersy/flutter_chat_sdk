# Flutter Chat SDK — Example App

Demo app for the `flutter_chat_sdk` package.

## Running

```bash
cd flutter_chat_sdk/example
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Make sure the `backend-node` server is running first:

```bash
cd backend-node
npm run dev
```

The example app connects to `http://localhost:3000` by default.
